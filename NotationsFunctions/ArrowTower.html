        <h1>The Arrow Tower</h1>
        <p>The Arrow Tower is a simple function.</p>
        Arrow towers stem from a simple idea, which is to iterate the arrow notation

        Let A(n,k) be a function mapping numbers n,k to a natural number m for n,k in \(\mathbb{N}\)

        First we start with the termination rule.

        A(n,0) = \(n\uparrow^{n}n\)

        Then, the recursion rule, which happens only when k is larger than or equal to 0. (because if k=0, k+1=1 i think)

        A(n,k+1) = \(A(n,k)\uparrow^{A(n,k)}A(n,k)\)

        This is a pretty simple and easy recursion, and I guess it is \(f_{\omega^2}(n)\), but I have no proof of this, so if you can please tell me roughly how fast it grows.
