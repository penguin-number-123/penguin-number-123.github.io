CB(n) or \(\delta(n)\) So, the chess board is a hypothetical Turing machine thing.<br />

Definition <br />
The maximum sum of BB(n)-1â€™s that can be written (in the finished plane), with BB(n) state and a BB(n) colour halting Turing machine. Note that we do not use a tape but a Plane. As well as that, we allow for movement in 8 directions. Up, down, left, right, up right, up left, down right, down left.
<br />
Better Explanation<br />
We have a read and write head moving on the infinite paper. Instead of turning it into a 0 or 1, it turns it into 0,1,2, etc, with n-1 as the maximum number. It reads and writes, until it eventually halts. The final question, is what is the sum of all n-1s?
<br />
Augmented CB(n)<br />
Also called \(\Delta(n)\) It should be more powerful. <br />

Instead of asking what is the sum of all n-1s, we ask what is the sum of all numbers that are not 0.<br />

Better Definition<br />
The maximum sum of all nonzero numbers that can be written (in the finished plane), with a BB(n) state and a BB(n) colour halting Turing machine. Note that we do not use a tape but a Plane. As well as that, we allow for movement in 8 directions. Up, down, left, right, up right, up left, down right, down left.
BB(n) is the busy beaver function.
